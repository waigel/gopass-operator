The `stringset` package implements a lightweight set-of-strings type based
around Go's built-in map type.

## Generating the Code

The `stringset` package is generated by the `makeset` program from source
templates `core.go.in` (the main package source) and `core_test.go.in` (for the
unit tests). To change the implementation, modify those templates and
re-generate the package source by running:

```shell
go run ./makeset -config makeset/stringset.toml -output .
```
